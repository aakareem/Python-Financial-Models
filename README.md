# Python-Financial-Models
Re-creating certain financial models using Python and Jupyter notebooks

Here I will be primarily using Pandas and Numpy to adapt simple excel financial models and recreate them using Python. Please note that most models I will be using are based on ones already existent on the web. 

As a point of reference I will be uploading the webpages or excel versions of the financial models whenever available in order to help users solidify their understanding of the models' dynamics.
